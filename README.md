Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements in Python allow you to control the flow of your program by executing certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are met. They are essential for decision-making in programming.


📌 Key Points

Indentation is mandatory in Python.

if, elif, and else must end with a colon (:).

Conditions usually involve comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=) and logical operators (and, or, not).

📝 Conclusion

Conditional statements are the building blocks of decision-making in Python. They allow programs to behave differently based on given conditions, making them dynamic and interactive.
